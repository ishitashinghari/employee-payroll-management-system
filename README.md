# employee-payroll-management-system

The Employee Payroll Management System is a C-based application designed to efficiently 
manage employee salary records. The system starts with a flowchart design to visually outline 
its workflow. It includes an Employee Data Management module that stores employee details 
such as ID, name, position, hours worked, hourly rate,etc. using structures. The Payroll Calculation module computes monthly wages based 
on hours worked and hourly rate, incorporating input validation and handling bonuses. The File 
Operations and Reporting module ensures that employee data is stored securely and generates 
formatted payroll reports for record-keeping. This project effectively utilizes structures, 
pointers, DMA, and file handling to create a modular and efficient payroll management system
